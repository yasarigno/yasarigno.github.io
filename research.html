  <p>In my PhD thesis I have studied the theory of Teichmüller spaces of surfaces of topologically infinite type.
    The first two of the following papers will be soon submitted to Arxiv and also appear here.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Infinite-dimensional Teichmüller spaces</li>
    <li>Ideal triangulations of surfaces of infinite type and quasiconformal Teichmüller spaces
      (joint with Athanase Papadopoulos et Daniele Alessandrini)</li>
    <li>A survey on line complexes on the simply connected Riemann surfaces</li>
  </ol>
